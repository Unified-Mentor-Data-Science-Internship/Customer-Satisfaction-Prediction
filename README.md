# Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict customer satisfaction using historical data. This involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze factors that influence customer satisfaction and build a predictive model.

About Dataset
The Customer Support Ticket Dataset is a dataset that includes customer support tickets for various tech products. It consists of customer inquiries related to hardware issues, software bugs, network problems, account access, data loss, and other support topics. The dataset provides information about the customer, the product purchased, the ticket type, the ticket channel, the ticket status, and other relevant details.
The dataset can be used for various analysis and modelling tasks in the customer service domain.

Features Description:
● Ticket ID: A unique identifier for each ticket.
● Customer Name: The name of the customer who raised the ticket.
● Customer Email: The email address of the customer (Domain name -
@example.com is intentional for user data privacy concern).
● Customer Age: The age of the customer.
● Customer Gender: The gender of the customer.
● Product Purchased: The tech product purchased by the customer.
● Date of Purchase: The date when the product was purchased.
● Ticket Type: The type of ticket (e.g., technical issue, billing inquiry, product
inquiry).
● Ticket Subject: The subject/topic of the ticket.
● Ticket Description: The description of the customer's issue or inquiry.
● Ticket Status: The status of the ticket (e.g., open, closed, pending customer
response).
● Resolution: The resolution or solution provided for closed tickets.
● Ticket Priority: The priority level assigned to the ticket (e.g., low, medium, high,
critical).
● Ticket Channel: The channel through which the ticket was raised (e.g., email,
phone, chat, social media).
● First Response Time: The time taken to provide the first response to the
customer.
● Time to Resolution: The time taken to resolve the ticket.
● Customer Satisfaction Rating: The customer's satisfaction rating for closed
tickets (on a scale of 1 to 5).

Use Cases of such dataset:
● Customer Support Analysis: The dataset can be used to analyze customer support ticket trends, identify common issues, and improve support processes.
● Natural Language Processing (NLP): The ticket descriptions can be used for training NLP models to automate ticket categorization or sentiment analysis.
● Customer Satisfaction Prediction: The dataset can be used to train models to predict customer satisfaction based on ticket information.
● Ticket Resolution Time Prediction: The dataset can be used to build models for predicting the time it takes to resolve a ticket based on various factors.
● Customer Segmentation: The dataset can be used to segment customers based on their ticket types, issues, or satisfaction levels.
● Recommender Systems: The dataset can be used to build recommendation systems for suggesting relevant solutions or products based on customer inquiries.
